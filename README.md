## Synopsis

**Thymer** is a full stack well aplication that allows users to navigate the kitchen with comfort and confidence. Thymer is a platform for users to write, save, and search recipes.

## Motivation

In today's busy world, fewer young adults are learning to cook becuase we feel that we are too busy to spend time in the kitchen. Too often, we try cooking to a recipe, but the recipe ends up taking twice or three times as long as we thought it would creating a stressful and unpleasant experience that keeps us from coming back to the kitchen to cook real, healthy, homemade food!

Thymer solves this problem. Thymer allows users to interact with friendly recipes in a way that matches our modern lifestyles and expectations. Thymer provides a platform for users to share recipes with friends and family and our format takes the guessing game out of cooking. With Thymer, we hope to help get young adults back in the kitchen and without losing control of their time and schedule.
